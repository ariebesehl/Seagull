## Description

Seagull is a native Windows application implementing Conway's Game of Life using the ZDK-library.

It has only basic functions and renders with OpenGL.

It is a more complete application designed to detail ZDK's functions, as opposed to the rather minimal deployments in the [Hello World](https://github.com/ariebesehl/HelloWorld) applications.
